Naruto is participating in Hidden Leaf village's Annual Car Race. There are NN connected dragstrips in the village.

Each participant would be given the IDs of the source stop, SS, the destination stop, DD, and a map of bidirectional (undirected) roads connecting different stops in Hidden leaf village. Generally speaking, most participants use shortest-distance paths to reach the destination; because of this, there is traffic included in these paths which slows down the participants.

Naruto won the race last year by using one of the second shortest-distance paths to reach the destination; however, he can't use the same trick again this year as 50%50% of the participants are also planning to use the second shortest-distance path during the race.

Naruto realizes that the only way to win the contest is to use one of the third shortest-distance paths. Help him find the total distance he must travel to reach the destination using one of the third shortest-distance paths; if no such third shortest-distance path exists, print -1-1.

Note:

    If a road belongs to any one of the 1st1st shortest paths, that road mustn't be a part of 2nd2nd or 3rd3rd shortest path.

    If a road belongs to any one of the 2nd2nd shortest paths, that road also mustn't be a part of the 3rd3rd shortest path.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The second line contains 22 space-separated integers, NN (the number of stops) and MM (the number of roads between stops), respectively.
The third line contains 22 space-separated integers, SS (the source, or starting point) and DD (the destination, or finish point), respectively. The MM subsequent lines each contain 33 space-separated integers: uu, vv, and distdist, where distdist denotes the distance between stop uu and stop vv.

Note: All stops are connected by undirected roads.

Explanation

[annual car race final.png]

* The source and destination are highlighted yellowyellow.

The shortest distance is 44, via the following paths: 0→1→5→60→1→5→6 and 0→3→60→3→6, highlighted in blue.

The second-shortest distance is 55 and the path is 0→2→60→2→6, highlighted in green.

The third-shortest distance is 77 and the path is 0→4→60→4→6, highlighted in orange.
